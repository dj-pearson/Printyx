# Printyx Data Schema Audit & Implementation Tracker
*Created: January 13, 2025*

## 🎯 **Objective**
Ensure all pages have proper database schema connections, complete field mappings, and accurate table relationships with no mock data. Every table header and editable field should correspond to actual database schema fields.

## 📊 **Audit Scope**
Based on DATABASE_SCHEMA_HIERARCHY.md (175 total tables), we'll audit all major functional areas:

### **Core Business Modules**
1. **CRM & Sales Pipeline** (15 tables)
2. **Product Management** (7 tables + 4 master catalog tables)
3. **Service Management** (12 tables)
4. **Financial/Billing** (25 tables)
5. **Warehouse/Inventory** (8 equipment + misc tables)
6. **Task & Project Management** (2 new tables)
7. **User & Tenant Management** (12 core tables)
