## Development Decisions Log

### 2024-01-31
- **Decision**: Use demo authentication mode for initial development
- **Rationale**: Allows faster development iteration while Replit Auth integration is stabilized
- **Impact**: Need to complete full auth implementation before production

- **Decision**: Implement core CRUD operations for all entities first
- **Rationale**: Establishes solid foundation before advanced features
- **Impact**: Sets up data relationships and validation patterns

- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Rationale**: Provides type safety and excellent PostgreSQL support
- **Impact**: Fast development with strong typing and migrations

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Implement meter billing system** - highest priority MVP feature
2. **Add service dispatch optimization** - critical for technician efficiency
3. **Enhance CRM with lead management** - sales pipeline visibility
4. **Create comprehensive demo data** - better user experience testing
5. **Add form validation across all interfaces** - improve user experience
