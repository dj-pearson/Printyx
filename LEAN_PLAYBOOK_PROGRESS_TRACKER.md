  - File: `server/routes-reports.ts`
- ‚úÖ **RBAC/tenancy enforcement**: All queries scoped by tenant and role
- ‚úÖ **Performance metrics**: Response times, error rates, data freshness

### 8. Database Performance
- ‚úÖ **Critical indexes created**:
  - Proposals: `idx_proposals_tenant_created`, `idx_proposals_tenant_status`
  - Meter readings: `idx_meter_readings_tenant_equipment_date`
  - Purchase orders: `idx_po_tenant_dates`

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Frontend DoD Integration (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **UI enforcement**: DoD validation buttons disable until criteria met
- ‚úÖ **Banner notifications**: Real-time validation banners show missing requirements with clear actions
- ‚úÖ **Drill-through links**: Auto-populate next stage forms from validated quotes
- ‚úÖ **Forms integrated**: QuotesManagement, ProposalBuilder, Contracts, PurchaseOrders

### 2. Breach Tiles & Dashboard Alerts (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **SLA breach tiles**: Real-time "Response SLA Breached (Last 24h)" and other critical alerts
