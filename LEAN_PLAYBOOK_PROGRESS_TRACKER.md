  - Routes: `/api/phone-tickets/search-companies`, `/api/phone-tickets/search-contacts/:companyId`, `/api/phone-tickets/equipment/:companyId`
- ✅ **Technician sessions**: Complete workflow management
  - Session creation, workflow steps, step completion endpoints
  - Photo/signature/parts usage persistence
- ✅ **Unified metrics source**: Phone-in and service tickets integrated

### 2. Billing Integration & Auto-Invoice
- ✅ **Auto-invoice generation**: Triggers on service completion
  - Schema: `autoInvoiceGeneration` table
  - Linking by `ticketId` implemented

  - File: `server/routes-enhanced-billing.ts`
  - Filters: `ticketId`, `contractId`, `issuance_delay_gt_24h`, `overdue`
- ✅ **Billing metrics**: Comprehensive analytics endpoint
  - Issuance delay tracking, auto-invoice success rates, revenue metrics

### 3. Purchase Orders & Variance Tracking
- ✅ **Variance filtering**: `/api/purchase-orders?filter=variance_gt_2x`
- ✅ **Database fields**: `approved_date`, `expected_date`, `order_date` columns
- ✅ **Performance indexes**: Tenant-scoped date indexes

### 4. Meter Readings & Missed Cycles
- ✅ **Missed cycles API**: `/api/meter-readings?filter=missed_cycles&n=N`
- ✅ **Database fields**: `bw_meter_reading`, `color_meter_reading`, `collection_method`
- ✅ **Performance indexes**: Equipment and date-based indexes

### 5. Warehouse FPY (First Pass Yield)
- ✅ **Complete FPY system**: Kitting operations tracking
  - File: `server/routes-warehouse-fpy.ts`
  - Schema: `warehouse-fpy-schema.ts`
- ✅ **FPY metrics**: Pass/fail rates, defect tracking
- ✅ **Drill-through queries**: Unit-level and aggregate reporting

### 6. Definition of Done (DoD) Enforcement
- ✅ **Stage validation**: Quote-to-proposal, proposal-to-contract, PO-to-warehouse
  - File: `server/routes-dod-enforcement.ts`
- ✅ **Validation endpoints**: `/api/validate/quote-to-proposal/:quoteId`, etc.
- ✅ **Workflow enforcement**: Server-side blocking with actionable error messages

### 7. Reports & Analytics
- ✅ **Comprehensive reporting API**: Service SLA, PO variance, meter metrics
  - File: `server/routes-reports.ts`
- ✅ **RBAC/tenancy enforcement**: All queries scoped by tenant and role
- ✅ **Performance metrics**: Response times, error rates, data freshness

### 8. Database Performance
- ✅ **Critical indexes created**:
  - Proposals: `idx_proposals_tenant_created`, `idx_proposals_tenant_status`
  - Meter readings: `idx_meter_readings_tenant_equipment_date`
  - Purchase orders: `idx_po_tenant_dates`

## ✅ COMPLETED FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Frontend DoD Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **UI enforcement**: DoD validation buttons disable until criteria met
- ✅ **Banner notifications**: Real-time validation banners show missing requirements with clear actions
- ✅ **Drill-through links**: Auto-populate next stage forms from validated quotes
- ✅ **Forms integrated**: QuotesManagement, ProposalBuilder, Contracts, PurchaseOrders

### 2. Breach Tiles & Dashboard Alerts (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **SLA breach tiles**: Real-time "Response SLA Breached (Last 24h)" and other critical alerts
- ✅ **Proposal aging alerts**: Drill-through to filtered views for immediate action
- ✅ **Dynamic dashboard**: Comprehensive BreachTiles component with severity-based styling
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Real-time breach detection with 60-second refresh intervals

### 3. Billing Table Schema Alignment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ⚠️ **Field mapping**: Currently using `invoices` table, need dedicated `billing_invoices`
- ⚠️ **Issuance delay tracking**: Need `issuance_delay_hours` field for accurate metrics
- **Action Required**: Schema migration or field additions to invoices table

### 4. User Training & SOPs (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Stage-specific SOPs**: Comprehensive process guidance for "Lead to Quote", "Quote to Proposal", "Proposal to Contract"
- ✅ **Embedded help**: SOPModal and ProcessHelpBanner components integrated into workflow forms
- ✅ **Change management**: Training components embedded directly in QuotesManagement, ProposalBuilder, and Contracts pages
- **Status**: Complete SOP system with contextual training guidance

### 5. Advanced Analytics (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Predictive insights**: PredictiveInsights component with customer renewal prediction, sales forecasting, and risk scoring
- ✅ **Anomaly detection**: AnomalyDetection component with real-time pattern recognition and automated alerts
- ✅ **Advanced Analytics Hub**: Comprehensive AdvancedAnalytics page with tabbed interface for all analytics features
- ✅ **AI-powered features**: Mock ML models for sales forecasting, churn prediction, and performance optimization
- **Status**: Complete advanced analytics foundation ready for ML integration
