## Data Segmentation Strategy

### 1. Tenant Isolation
- All business data filtered by `tenantId`
- Platform users can access multiple tenants

### 2. Location Filtering
- Users with `location` scope see only their location's data
- Users with `regional` scope see all locations in their region
- Users with `company` scope see all locations in their tenant

### 3. Department Filtering
- Sales users see sales data, Service users see service data
- Managers can see their department + some cross-department data
- C-Level sees all departments

### 4. Hierarchical Data Access
- Managers can see their direct reports' data
- Regional managers can see all location managers' data in their region
- Company admins can see all data in their tenant

## Permission Examples

### Sales Rep (Level 1, Location Scope)
```json
{
  "customers": ["read", "create", "update"],
  "leads": ["read", "create", "update"], 
  "contracts": ["read"],
  "service_tickets": ["read_assigned"],
  "reports": ["personal_metrics"],
  "location_scope": ["primary_location_only"]
}
```

### Regional Sales Manager (Level 6, Regional Scope)
```json
{
  "customers": ["read", "create", "update", "reassign"],
  "leads": ["read", "create", "update", "reassign"],
  "contracts": ["read", "approve_regional"],
  "service_tickets": ["read_all"],
  "reports": ["regional_metrics", "location_comparisons"],
  "users": ["manage_regional_sales"],
  "location_scope": ["assigned_regions"]
}
```

### CEO (Level 7, Company Scope)
```json
{
  "all_modules": ["full_access"],
  "financials": ["company_wide"],

  "locations": ["create", "modify", "deactivate"],
  "regions": ["create", "modify", "assign_managers"],
  "location_scope": ["all_company_locations"]
}
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Performance
- Indexed by tenantId, locationId, regionId for fast filtering
- Role-based query optimization
- Cached permission lookups

### Security
- Row-level security enforced at database level
- Multi-layered permission checks
- Audit trail for cross-location access

### Management
- Automated role assignment based on hierarchy
- Bulk user management tools for Regional/Company admins
- Role inheritance and delegation features

### Growth Path
- Additional middle management levels can be added
- Specialized roles (e.g., Technical Specialist, Account Executive)
- Matrix organization support (users reporting to multiple managers)
