# Navigation Consolidation Working Document

## ✅ COMPLETED - Collapsible Dropdown Navigation System

## Behavior Rules

1. **Expansion Logic**: Only the current section expands to show nested pages
2. **Collapse Logic**: When navigating to a different section, the previous section collapses
3. **Visual Indicators**: Carrot/chevron icons indicate expandable sections
4. **Active States**: Current page highlighted, parent section expanded
5. **Click Behavior**: Clicking on hub pages either navigates to the hub or toggles expansion

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### Key Components Created:
1. **`CollapsibleSidebar.tsx`** - Main navigation component with dropdown functionality
2. **`useCollapsibleNavigation.ts`** - Hook managing expansion/collapse logic and route detection
3. **Updated `main-layout.tsx`** - Integrated new sidebar with mobile fallback

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Automatic section expansion based on current route
- ✅ Chevron indicators (ChevronRight/ChevronDown) for expandable sections  
- ✅ Clean collapse behavior when navigating between sections
- ✅ Active state highlighting for current page and parent sections
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design with fallback navigation
- ✅ Smooth animations and accessible interactions

### Navigation Structure:
- **8 Hub Sections** with collapsible dropdowns (CRM, Service, Product, Equipment, Billing, Reports, Tasks)
- **4 Always-Visible** sections (Dashboard, Customers, Settings, Integrations)
- **Total 42 nested pages** organized under logical hub sections

### User Experience:
- Salesperson in CRM sees: CRM expanded with 6 nested pages, all other hubs collapsed
- When navigating to Service Hub: CRM collapses, Service expands with its 3 nested pages
- Clean, focused navigation reduces cognitive load and improves workflow efficiency
