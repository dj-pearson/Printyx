**Total Estimated Effort**: 28-37 weeks (7-9 months with 1 developer)

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize based on business impact** - Focus on revenue-generating modules first
2. **Resource allocation** - Determine team size and timeline
3. **Architectural review** - Ensure scalability for new features
4. **User feedback integration** - Validate requirements with stakeholders
5. **Phased implementation** - Break work into manageable sprints

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with some well-implemented modules, but several core business functions need significant development work. The service dispatch and inventory management systems are particularly critical for business operations and should be prioritized. The customer records system needs consolidation to eliminate data inconsistencies.

The estimated 7-9 months of development work represents substantial effort but will transform the application from a basic CRUD system into a comprehensive business management platform.
