   ```typescript
   import { seedReportDefinitions } from './server/routes-reporting-definitions';
   await seedReportDefinitions('tenant-id');
   ```

3. **Test API endpoints with existing user roles**
   ```bash
   # Test report discovery
   GET /api/reports
   
   # Test report execution
   GET /api/reports/sales_pipeline_overview/data?from_date=2025-01-01&to_date=2025-01-31
   
   # Test KPI access
   GET /api/kpis?category=sales
   ```

### Phase 2 Planning (Week 2-3)
- **Frontend dashboard components** using existing UI patterns
- **Department-specific dashboards** for Sales, Service, Finance
