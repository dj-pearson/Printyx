## 🔌 API Integration

### Endpoints Integrated
```typescript
// Reports Discovery
GET /api/reporting/reports
  ✅ Category filtering
  ✅ Search functionality
  ✅ Permission-based access

// KPI Dashboard
GET /api/reporting/kpis
  ✅ Real-time data fetching
  ✅ Category-specific KPIs
  ✅ Trend calculations

// Report Execution
GET /api/reporting/reports/:id/data
  ✅ Dynamic parameter injection
  ✅ Hierarchical filtering
  ✅ Cache optimization

// Export Functionality
POST /api/reporting/reports/export
  ✅ Frontend integration ready
  ⏳ Backend implementation pending
```

### Data Flow
```
1. User selects filters → React Query → API call
2. Backend applies RBAC → Hierarchical filtering → SQL execution
3. Cache check → Data transformation → Response
4. Frontend updates → React state → UI re-render
5. Auto-refresh cycle → Background updates → Real-time sync
```
