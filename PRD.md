# Unified Copier Dealer Management Platform PRD

**Bottom Line Up Front**: The copier dealer industry represents a $39.3 billion market with 4,762 dealers struggling with fragmented technology stacks that create operational inefficiencies, data silos, and missed revenue opportunities. **A unified platform consolidating meter billing, service dispatch, inventory management, and customer relationship management can capture significant market share by addressing critical pain points that existing solutions fail to solve comprehensively.**

This Product Requirements Document outlines the development of a unified SaaS platform targeting small-to-medium copier dealers (5-200 employees) who currently manage operations across multiple disconnected systems. The platform will initially focus on core operational workflows with plans to scale enterprise features, positioning against market leader e-automate through superior integration, modern architecture, and competitive pricing.

## Market opportunity and business context

The copier dealer industry faces a perfect storm of operational challenges that create significant opportunities for technology consolidation. **Current market leader e-automate dominates with 95% of Elite Dealers but suffers from high costs ($50-150/user/month), complex modular pricing, and limited integration capabilities.** Dealers typically operate 5-8 separate software systems including CRM (AgentDealer), ERP (e-automate), manufacturer fleet management platforms (Canon, Xerox), service dispatch systems (MobileTech), toner monitoring (Printanista), and accounting software (QuickBooks).

**Market sizing reveals 4,762 copier dealers generating $39.3 billion in revenue, with the majority being small-medium businesses averaging 5-50 employees and $387,000-$1.08 million annual revenue.** These dealers spend 4.1-6.9% of revenue on IT, creating a addressable software market of $16,000-$74,500 per dealer annually. Despite this substantial spending, dealers report significant operational inefficiencies due to system fragmentation.

**Key pain points identified through comprehensive research include**: manual data entry between systems, fragmented customer information, complex billing processes requiring multiple systems, technician productivity losses from using separate mobile applications, and inability to generate unified profitability reports across all operations. Field Force Tracker customers report "80% sales increases year over year" after implementing comprehensive dealer management software, demonstrating the transformative potential of unified platforms.

## Business operations analysis

### Complete sales funnel workflow

**Lead generation** occurs through digital marketing (SEO, PPC, local search), referral programs, direct mail campaigns, cold calling, industry events, and third-party lead services like Peak Marketing Service. **Prospect qualification** involves Business Technology Assessments (BTA) to understand printing workflows, decision maker identification, budget qualification, and timeline assessment. **Demo scheduling** requires coordination through CRM systems with equipment preparation and site visit coordination.

**Proposal creation** demands requirements documentation, solution design, pricing structure development (lease vs. purchase options), contract preparation with Master lease agreements, and internal approval processes. **Contract negotiation** covers lease duration (typically 36-60 months), service level agreements with response times, usage-based billing arrangements, end-of-term options, and legal review processes. **Deal closure** involves credit approval through leasing companies, contract execution, equipment ordering and delivery coordination, and customer onboarding workflow setup.

### Inventory and asset management systems

**Equipment tracking** requires comprehensive serial number management from receipt to deployment, asset status monitoring (available, deployed, in-service, returned), location management across warehouse and customer sites, and condition assessment categorization. **Parts and consumables management** involves automated reordering with supplier system integration, field technician stock management, consumables tracking (toner, drums, maintenance kits), and vendor integration with major suppliers like OEM partners and distributors.

**Ordering from manufacturers** utilizes purchase order automation with manufacturer platforms, drop-ship arrangements for customer delivery, bulk ordering for inventory optimization, and special order management for custom configurations. **Stock level management** employs automated alerts for reorder triggers, demand forecasting through historical analysis, safety stock calculations, and ABC analysis for inventory categorization by usage frequency and value.

### Service and maintenance workflows

**Service call scheduling** integrates customer portals for self-service, dispatcher coordination with technician optimization, priority management for emergency vs. routine service, and automated scheduling with AI-driven routing optimization. **Technician dispatch systems** create automated work orders, assign technicians based on skills and availability, provide mobile integration for real-time updates, and maintain customer communication with arrival time notifications.
