### Middleware Integration

#### 1. Audit Log Middleware
```typescript
// Automatic audit logging for all protected routes
auditLogMiddleware('CREATE_CUSTOMER', 'customers', 'medium', 'data_modification')
```

#### 2. Data Access Middleware
```typescript
// Track all data access with classification
dataAccessLogMiddleware('customers', 'confidential')
```

#### 3. Session Security Middleware
```typescript
// Automatic session timeout and security checks
sessionTimeoutMiddleware()
```

### Frontend Security Dashboard

#### Comprehensive Security Monitoring (`client/src/pages/SecurityCompliance.tsx`)
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live security metrics and alerts
- **Audit Log Browser**: Searchable, filterable audit trail interface
- **GDPR Request Management**: Complete request lifecycle management
- **Session Monitoring**: Active session tracking and termination
- **Compliance Settings**: Configurable security parameters

#### Key Dashboard Features:
- **Security Metrics**: Active sessions, GDPR requests, security alerts, data access events
- **Risk Visualization**: Risk scores, suspicious activity alerts, trend analysis
- **Compliance Tracking**: GDPR request status, audit statistics, compliance timelines
- **Administrative Controls**: Session termination, request processing, settings management

### Security Utilities

#### Data Sanitization
```typescript
// Automatic removal of sensitive data from logs
sanitizeForAudit(data) // Removes passwords, tokens, keys, credit cards, SSNs
```

#### Data Masking
```typescript
// Mask sensitive data for display
maskSensitiveData(value, 'email') // user@*****.com
maskSensitiveData(value, 'phone') // 555***1234
```

#### Encryption Utilities
```typescript
// Encrypt sensitive database fields
encryptSensitiveData(plaintext) // Returns { encrypted, iv, tag }
decryptSensitiveData(encryptedData) // Returns plaintext
```
