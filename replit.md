# Printyx - Unified Copier Dealer Management Platform

## Overview
Printyx is a unified SaaS platform designed to consolidate fragmented technology stacks for small-to-medium copier dealers. It replaces disconnected legacy systems (CRM, billing, service dispatch, inventory) with a single, integrated solution, aiming to eliminate data silos, reduce manual processes, and provide comprehensive management for all aspects of a copier dealership.

The platform has successfully implemented a Root Admin security suite with Social Media Generation, comprehensive Security Management, System Monitoring, and Access Control systems. Key features include AI-powered analytics (customer churn, CLV, predictive maintenance), an Advanced Integration Hub, and Advanced Workflow Automation. Printyx also offers comprehensive customer success management, remote monitoring with IoT integration, advanced document management, and a mobile service app for field technicians. It provides meter billing, service dispatch, CRM, a unified business records system, and integrates with E-Automate, Salesforce, QuickBooks Online, ZoomInfo, and Apollo.io.

## Mobile-First Development Guidelines

### üéØ Core Mobile Principles
**ALWAYS follow these mobile-first principles when developing any component:**

#### 1. Touch Target Standards (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - All interactive elements must meet 44√ó44px minimum
size: "mobile"           // min-h-12 px-6 py-3 text-base
className="min-h-11 touch-manipulation"

// ‚ùå INCORRECT - Too small for mobile
size: "sm"              // h-9 - TOO SMALL!
className="h-8 w-8"     // TOO SMALL!
```

#### 2. Form Input Optimization (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always include these for mobile forms
<Input
  inputMode="email"           // Shows appropriate keyboard
  className="min-h-11 text-base sm:text-sm"  // 16px prevents iOS zoom
  autoComplete="email"        // Enables autofill
/>

// ‚ùå INCORRECT - Missing mobile optimizations
<Input className="h-9 text-sm" />  // Will cause iOS zoom!
```

#### 3. Mobile-First Grid Layouts (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Start with mobile, enhance for larger screens
className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-3 sm:gap-4"

// ‚ùå INCORRECT - Desktop-first approach
className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4"
```

#### 4. Typography Scaling (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Mobile-first typography with responsive scaling
className="text-base sm:text-lg"      // 16px mobile, 18px desktop
className="text-sm sm:text-base"      // 14px mobile, 16px desktop

// ‚ùå INCORRECT - Fixed small text that's hard to read on mobile
className="text-sm"                   // Too small for mobile!
```

#### 5. Safe Area Support (REQUIRED for fixed elements)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Support devices with notches/dynamic islands
className="pb-safe-bottom pt-safe-top"

// Add to index.css if not present:
@supports (padding: env(safe-area-inset-top)) {
  .pb-safe-bottom { padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom); }
  .pt-safe-top { padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top); }
}
```

### üì± Component-Specific Guidelines

#### Button Component Usage
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Mobile-optimized button usage
<Button size="mobile" className="w-full sm:w-auto">
  Action Button
</Button>

// Available sizes in order of mobile-friendliness:
// "mobile" (best for mobile) ‚Üí "default" ‚Üí "lg" ‚Üí "sm" (avoid on mobile)
```

#### Form Field Best Practices
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Complete mobile-optimized form field
<TextField
  control={control}
  name="email"
  label="Email Address"
  type="email"
  inputMode="email"           // Keyboard optimization
  autoComplete="email"        // Autofill support
  placeholder="Enter your email"
/>
```

#### Mobile Table Component
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use enhanced mobile table for complex data
<MobileTable
  data={customers}
  columns={[
    { key: 'name', label: 'Name', priority: 'high', icon: <User /> },
    { key: 'status', label: 'Status', priority: 'medium', badge: true },
    { key: 'phone', label: 'Phone', priority: 'low', icon: <Phone /> }
  ]}
  onRowClick={handleRowClick}
  loading={isLoading}
  emptyMessage="No customers found"
/>
```

#### Bottom Navigation (Fixed Mobile Nav)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Mobile bottom navigation with safe area support
<div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-background/95 backdrop-blur pb-safe-bottom">
  <nav className="flex items-center justify-around py-1 px-2 min-h-16">
    {/* Navigation items with proper touch targets */}
  </nav>
</div>
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

#### Before Creating Any Component:
1. **Start Mobile-First**: Design for 320px width first
2. **Ensure Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ‚â• 44√ó44px
3. **Test on Device**: Use browser dev tools mobile simulator
4. **Validate Typography**: Ensure 16px minimum for inputs
5. **Check Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Touch targets meet 44√ó44px minimum
- [ ] Forms prevent iOS zoom (16px font minimum)
- [ ] Responsive grid works on all screen sizes
- [ ] Safe area support on devices with notches
- [ ] Proper keyboard types for different inputs
- [ ] Accessibility with screen readers
- [ ] Performance on slower mobile devices

#### Mobile Test File:
Use `/workspaces/Printyx/mobile-test.html` to validate:
- Safe area support functionality
- Touch target compliance
- Form input behavior
- Mobile-first responsive grids
- Typography scaling
- Bottom navigation functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mobile Pitfalls to AVOID:

1. **Desktop-First Grids**: Never start with `md:grid-cols-*`
2. **Small Touch Targets**: Never use elements smaller than 44√ó44px
3. **Small Text Inputs**: Always use 16px minimum font size
4. **Fixed Small Typography**: Avoid non-responsive small text
5. **Missing inputMode**: Always specify appropriate keyboard type
6. **Ignoring Safe Areas**: Support devices with notches/islands
7. **Poor Touch Feedback**: Always include active/touch states

### üìö Mobile-First Resources:
- **Button Component**: `/client/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- **Form Components**: `/client/src/components/forms/FormField.tsx`
- **Mobile Table**: `/client/src/components/responsive/mobile-table.tsx`
- **Bottom Nav**: `/client/src/components/ui/mobile-bottom-nav.tsx`
- **Global Mobile CSS**: `/client/src/index.css`
- **Mobile Documentation**: `/workspaces/Printyx/Mobile.md`

## External Dependencies

### Database Services
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting.
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: WebSocket database connections.

### Authentication Services
- **Replit Auth**: OpenID Connect authentication provider.
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware.

### Frontend Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI components.
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management.
- **React Hook Form**: Form library.
- **Wouter**: Routing library.
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities.

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation.
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration and schema management.

## Critical Architecture Rules
- **SIDEBAR CONSOLIDATION**: The application uses ONLY `role-based-sidebar.tsx` for all navigation. The old `sidebar.tsx` has been permanently removed. All navigation modifications must be done in `role-based-sidebar.tsx`. Never create additional sidebar files or components.
