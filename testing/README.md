## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
netstat -an | findstr :5000  # Windows
lsof -i :5000               # Linux/Mac

# Use different port
PORT=5001 npm run dev
```

### Puppeteer issues

```bash
# Reinstall with proper permissions
npm install puppeteer --unsafe-perm=true
```

### Permission errors

```bash
# Linux/Mac only
chmod +x run.sh
```

## 🚀 Integration

- name: Run UI Tests
  run: |
    cd testing
    npm install
    npm run test
```

### React Dashboard

```tsx
import TestMonitor from "./testing/components/TestMonitor";

<TestMonitor autoConnect={true} />;
